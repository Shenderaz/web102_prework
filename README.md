## Required Features
 The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.

 The Stats section includes information about the total contributions, total dollars raised, and the top two most funded games.

 The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding.

 The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display:

    only unfunded games,

    only funded games, or

    all games.

Features are implemented:

[ ]Cards include game image, description, goal, pledged amount, and number of backers.

## Notes
One challenge was learning how to use JavaScript to add game cards to the page. I had to figure out how to create elements and show them using code instead of writing them by hand in HTML.

It was a bit hard to get the filter buttons to work, like showing only funded or unfunded games. I had to make sure the old games were removed before showing the new ones.

Using reduce() to add up the total money and backers was confusing at first. I learned how the function works and how to make the numbers look nicer with commas.

Making the website look like the example was a little tricky. I had to learn more about CSS and Flexbox to organize the cards and make the design look good.

Picking the top two games based on money raised took a bit of time. I had to use sorting and a new way to get just the top two from the list.

This project helped me understand DOM manipulation, filtering arrays, and basic frontend structure using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
